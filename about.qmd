## Welcome

Hi, welcome to my site. I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at [Aalborg University](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/dosc).

My research focuses on the political economy of European integration and comparative political behavior within the European Union. I explore how inequalities influence political attitudes and engagement, particularly regarding European integration. Additionally, I examine the role of public policy in addressing and reducing these inequalities.

For the period 2019â€“2024, I received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation for a large research project on regional inequality and the political geography of EU support. Over the past years, my work has been published in leading political science journals, including:

-   *British Journal of Political Science*
-   *Journal of Politics*
-   *European Journal of Political Research*
-   *Comparative Political Studies*
-   *Journal of European Public Policy*

I am co-chair of the Political Behavior and Political Communication section of the Danish Political Science Association. I also lead the [Comparative Politics Research Group](https://www.politics-society.aau.dk/research/institutions-policy-and-behavior/comparative-politics-compol) at Aalborg University and serve on the editorial board of the *Journal of European Public Policy*. Additionally, I am part of the [European NUTS-Level Election Dataset (EU-NED)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IQRYP5) project.
