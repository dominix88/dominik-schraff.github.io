    "text": "Hi, welcome to my site. I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at Aalborg University.\nMy research focuses on the political economy of European integration and comparative political behavior within the European Union. I explore how inequalities influence political attitudes and engagement, particularly regarding European integration. Additionally, I examine the role of public policy in addressing and reducing these inequalities.\nFor the period 2019â€“2024, I received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation for a large research project on regional inequality and the political geography of EU support. Over the past years, my work has been published in leading political science journals, including:\n\nBritish Journal of Political Science\nJournal of Politics\nEuropean Journal of Political Research\nComparative Political Studies\nJournal of European Public Policy\n\nI am co-chair of the Political Behavior and Political Communication section of the Danish Political Science Association. I also lead the Comparative Politics Research Group at Aalborg University and serve on the editorial board of the Journal of European Public Policy. Additionally, I am part of the European NUTS-Level Election Dataset (EU-NED) project."
